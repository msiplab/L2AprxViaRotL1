## üìå Overview

This project provides a practical implementation of a novel method for approximating the ‚Ñì‚ÇÇ-norm of 2-dimensional data using a rotated ‚Ñì‚ÇÅ-norm. The approximation improves computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy, which is especially useful for fixed-point arithmetic.

The key idea is to rotate the coordinate system to align the ‚Ñì‚ÇÅ-norm with the ‚Ñì‚ÇÇ-norm contour as closely as possible.
